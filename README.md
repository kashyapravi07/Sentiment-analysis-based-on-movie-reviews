**Technologies Used**
Python: Programming language for implementing the project.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model training and evaluation.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): For text preprocessing and NLP tasks.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding and project documentation.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a collection of movie reviews, which can be sourced from various platforms like IMDb or Kaggle. Each review is labeled as either positive or negative.

**Installation**

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-movie-reviews.git
cd sentiment-analysis-movie-reviews

Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:


pip install -r requirements.txt

**Usage**
Prepare the dataset by ensuring it is in the correct format and placed in the appropriate directory.

Run the Jupyter Notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance:


jupyter notebook sentiment_analysis.ipynb
**Model Training**
The model training process includes the following steps:

**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning the text data, removing stop words, tokenization, and other NLP tasks.
**Feature Extraction:** Converting text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF.
**Model Selection:** Choosing and training machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Support Vector Machines (SVM).
**Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Results**
The results section summarizes the performance of the trained models on the test dataset. Include visualizations like confusion matrices, ROC curves, and any other relevant charts to illustrate the results.
